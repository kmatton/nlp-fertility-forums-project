I’m 38 and just suffered my second miscarriage in a row. I got pregnant last November by IUI (my husband has a low sperm count due to an undescended testicle as a child). We lost that baby in December after seeing the heartbeat at 8 weeks. I had a D&C in January when things didn’t seem to be progressing and we wanted to try again. We got pregnant again in June but at this last ultrasound on Friday they couldn’t see anything. No yolk sac, no fetal pole. So the told me I’d likely lost this one too. I’m going back in next week to confirm then likely another D&C.  I’ve been doing some reading and it seems like even women who have recurring miscarriages are 65% likely to have a third successful pregnancy. So, has anyone here gone on to have a pregnancy after multiple miscarriages? Did your doctors do anything different? I suppose I just don’t want to be alone in this boat, though I would not wish this on anyone. My fertility doc wanted me to set up an appointment after the confirmation ultrasound next week. Any idea what to expect? Thanks in advance. \n",

I come home on Sunday then travel back out on Wednesday and stay through the retrieval, etc... They will use ICSI for insemination and genetic testing on any embryos due to our diagnosis.

When I began this TTC#2 thing in 2014, I was down to my pre-baby weight. I was at the top of my game fitness-wise.  I was happy and hopeful.  Now, I'm 25 lbs heavier....and that's not even counting how heavy my heart feels.  Maybe I should just quit while I'm \"ahead.\"  I know how fortunate I am to have my son; it's a feeling that gets stronger and stronger with each loss. In some ways, I feel like I don't even have the right to this sadness because I do have him. I also wonder what kind of parent and wife I have even been over the last 20 plus months.  Two pregnancies with debilitating morning sickness. One miscarriage that left me horribly anemic. A TFMR that left me emotionally broken. The wild hormonal shifts of being pregnant and then not being pregnant. The fucking partial molar cloud that will follow me forever. The entire exhausting process of TTC.  I shrunk my social life down to my inner circle so I never have to make small talk.  I stopped weight-lifting with an awesome crew of ladies because I thought it may help my ability to maintain a pregnancy. I went to therapy. I got on Zoloft. I started yoga. I bought the most expensive prenatal vitamins.  I feel like Sisyphus. I feel like this whole process has robbed me of hope and joy.  It's made me so brittle. I am so goddamn angry....and lonely and I'm not even alone and that again makes me feel ungrateful.  I try so goddamn hard to focus on all the good shit I have.  I know that happiness/joy/being grateful can be mutually exclusive from grief and loss. Fuck, I'm living that.  I dunno.  I just wish there was a sign that told me it was time to \"tap-out\" of this whole process.  I feel like I just keep getting up to be knocked down again and I'm too stupid or too stubborn to stop getting up.  \n",
